Hey! You could pretty much say that I have had a busy ROBLOX career. It's a pain whenever you want to switch to a new SCPF or clan and have to explain your in-depth positions that you have occupied.
This repo/site has been made by myself to rectify that. All entries are chronological. All entries are also positions that I worked for. Free-ranking isn't something that I endorse. Please excuse any formatting errors, this is my first time using markdown to make a github site.
## SCPFs
As you will probably see down below, I have a profeciency with intelligence departments.
### Icesniper5's SCPF (52,000 members / Mar 2017 to Dec 2017)
After being transferred to a shady group dealer, I was removed from my positions. The group was removed in 2020 as it broke ROBLOX Terms of Service.
- ISD O5 - 11
- EC O5 - 7
### Creepysins' SCPF (90,000 members* / Aug 2017 to Jun 2018)
Okay so this will probably result in people discrediting my resume, but I'll go ahead and put it here anyways.

### SethWyd's SCPF (6,000 members / Mar 2019 to Jan 2020)
