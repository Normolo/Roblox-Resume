Hey! You could pretty much say that I have had a busy ROBLOX career. It's a pain whenever you want to switch to a new SCPF or clan and have to explain your in-depth positions that you have occupied.
This repo/site has been made by myself to rectify that. All entries are chronological. All entries are also positions that I worked for. Free-ranking isn't something that I endorse.
## SCPFs
### Icesniper5's SCPF
After being transferred to a shady group dealer, I was removed from my positions. The group was removed in 2020 as it broke ROBLOX Terms of Service.
1. ISD O5-11
2. EC O5-7
### Creepsins' SCPF
Okay so this will probably result in poeple discrediting my resume, but I'll go ahead and put it here anyways.
1. ISD Deputy Director
### SethWyd's SCPF
